			   The best and the most famous Queen Channa Bhairavi Devi of Jain religion ruled the 
			   Selva kingdom few centuries ago. Her kingdom was known for forest produce and spice, 
			   especially pepper all over the trading world.  So she was known as PEPPER QUEEN. Forest produce being the main income, she  built her capital in the middle of the forest on an island, called 'BASADI'. 
			   It had over 70 Basadis (Jain Temple),of which you can see only ruins now.
